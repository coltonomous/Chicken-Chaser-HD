# Chicken-Chaser-HD
This is the same game as the other Chicken Chaser, this one just uses nicer assets.

Second incarnation of my previous pygame game Runaway Racer. Like its predecessor, it also has a setup file for use with cx_freeze to convert the game into a standalone exe if you so wish. Assets were pulled from all over, so some potential licensing conflicts might arise from that.

The gameplay mechanics have been tweaked so that score is accumulated by playing "chicken" with the new chicken obstacles. That is, you gain score by being on course to hit the falling chickens and lose score for actually hitting them.

Controls: Left and Right arrow keys to move side to side. "P" to pause and unpause the game.

Dependencies: Python 2.7.3 pygame for Python 2.7.3 cx_freeze for Python 2.7.3 (for setup file only) Python's random library (for randomly spawning the obstacles.

Licensing: None. Go ham, just be careful of the assets.
